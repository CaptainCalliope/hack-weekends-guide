Hack Weekends Guide
===================

This is an open source template for organizing a hackathon.

This template contains a how-to-guide with accompanying hackathon web site running on Github Pages + Jekyll.

I wanted to provide a single README file for scanning, with as much support material as possible.  So you can easily understand the wonderful world of hackathons and begin planning and executing hackathons in your community.

This open source guide is compiled with material from:

* Research from 2011 / 2012 on Hackathons
* Organizing Hackathons
* Open Data Hackathon How to Guide
* The Hack Day Manifesto
* Numerous tip articles across the blogosphere

# Overview

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers, interface designers, project managers and computational philologists, collaborate intensively on software projects. Occasionally, there is a hardware component as well. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week in length. Some hackathons are intended simply for educational or social purposes, although in many cases the goal is to create usable software. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created. Today, this term is not related to "hacking", it is just a programming marathon.{1}

## History

The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon". The term seems to have been created independently by both the developers of OpenBSD and the marketing team of Sun; these usages both first happened in 1999. OpenBSD's apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where 10 developers came together to avoid legal problems caused by export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States.{1}

Starting in the mid to late 2000s, hackathons became significantly more widespread, and began to be increasingly viewed by companies and venture capitalists as a way to quickly develop new software technologies, and to locate new areas for innovation and funding.{1}

Hackathon are not intended to perform illegal activities around computer networks. Software developers widely see hacking as a quick and dirty, creative programming solution to a problem.  It is NOT about gaining access to other networks, which is a definition widely publicized by the media and Hollywood.{2}

## Why Hold a Hackathon?
Before you run a Hackathon, it’s useful to think about the purpose behind it.  What are you hoping to accomplish?  Your goal can be as general as “increase awareness around open data” or more specific, such as “fix at least 10 bugs in software application X”. {3}

As well, think about the stakeholders for your event, including attendees, volunteers, sponsors and third parties, and what they might get out the experience or how they might be impacted.  For example, you may want your attendees to be inspired or have them learn new skills.  You might want a third party, for example the homeless, to benefit. {3} 

And finally, it’s useful to think about what you will get out of the event.  Is it an opportunity to build your community?  Perhaps an opportunity to demonstrate leadership or to practice facilitation? {3}

Paying attention to what your various stakeholders might get out of the hackathon and being intentional about people having a positive experience can greatly increase your likelihood of success.  Knowing what you want is a large part of getting it.{3}

# Hackathon Planning

## Assemble a  Team

People like to help out with causes that they believe in.  Involving others in the planning and running of your Hackathon is not only practical, it’s a way to give others an opportunity to contribute.  Here are several practical roles for people that will help your Hackathon run smoothly: {3}

* <strong>Facilitator</strong> - The person who manages the Hackathon process.
* <strong>Ringer</strong> - A participant who understands open data concepts and the technologies involved and who can work on projects and help others to work on their projects.
* <strong>Room Manager</strong> - The room manager is someone that people can go to when they are not sure what to do and would like some direction.  People who attend may have little or no experience with Hackathons.  The room manager is the go-to person for those who do not know what to do or how they can help.  
* <strong>Social Media Manager</strong> - This person will Tweet and update Facebook and Google+ status for your event.  If your organization has its own Twitter or other social media accounts, you may want to consider giving this person temporary access so they can manage the social media tools for the event. {3}

## Title and Description

Give your event a catchy name that represents your goals and will stick in the minds of developers.

Provide a detailed, but concise description of your event.  Generally 250-750 characters is sufficient to explain the theme and goals of the hackathon.

## Format

Hackathons got their beginning in cryptographic software development and was popularized by Silicon Valley startup culture.  However hackathons have moved into a wide variety of niches, not always centered around technology, including:

Art, Civic, Data, Education, Games, Green Energy, Health, Journalism, Language, Mobile, Movies, Music, Photos, Politicis, Robotics, Science, Sports, Water, Women and more.

The boundaries of what format a hackathon can assume is endless.  But there are some great examples being executed globally that might work for your hackathon.

## Size

Hackathons come in all sizes.  They can be as small as 5-10 people or as big as 500.

When it comes to hackathons, bigger isn't always better, but conducting larger events without proper experience and resources can be a major disaster.

Keep size in line with your over goal for throwing a hackathon

## Scheduling

### Choose a Date

Choosing a good date for your Hackathon can have a significant influence on how well it is attended and how much impact it has.  Hackathons take concentrated effort over at least one day, so community Hackathons are typically held on weekends when most people are not working.  Make sure you choose a date far enough in advance to allow yourself time to promote it to attendees.  {3} 

In addition, we recommend that if possible, you avoid the following when choosing your date: 
* holiday weekends
*politically significant dates, such as elections, especially if you are organizing a  government open data Hackathon
* religious holidays
* summer months if possible (it can be challenging to gather together attendees, especially in smaller cities.)
* weekends with events already scheduled that will compete with your event for attendees (other Hackathons, ChangeCamps, conferences) {3}

### Choose a Time

It’s important to choose a timeframe that works for your expected audience. If your Hackathon will run from 9am - 5pm and targets working developers, it may be best to host it on a weekend. This will minimize time conflict with your participants’ employment. {3}

Make clear the schedule of your event to participants in advance. If you choose a 9am start time, expect 20% to show up at 10am. Having an itinerary published at event signup will help make sure you can get started earlier. Schedule reception type activities at the beginning of the day to allow for some late arrivals. {3}

### Checking for Clashes
One of the most frustrating things for attendees to see is two similar events on the same day in the same area. To avoid this, check places like Lanyrd and Eventbrite, and ask on twitter “anything going on in X on X”. Remember that people may be travelling long distances for hack days, so even if an event is a few hundred miles away, you are still diluting your potental audience. {4}

## Choose a Venue

The venue you select should be the right size and style for your event.  Hackathons can be held in many different venues, such as pubs, coffee shops or restaurants (if they have a separate space), rooms on campuses, or work areas or boardrooms provided by sponsors. {3}   

Choose the right style of venue for your event.  For example, choosing a pub for a Hackathon where some of your desired participants are underage will not work well. {3}  

Choose the right size of venue as well.  Asking for pre-registration can help in choosing an appropriately-sized venue.  It is not always a reliable indicator as some folks do not like to commit or are reluctant to share their email addresses.  That said, asking them to register beforehand will give you some idea of how many will attend.  You can use a web service such as EventBrite, or you can simply use a Google spreadsheet. {3}

It should be possible to find a venue that you can use for free, although this is not always the case.  The venue should be located somewhere accessible for most of your attendees.  Ideally, it would also be free of access controls (e.g., locked doors). Where this is not possible, make sure that you have clear signage or greeters to make sure everyone can access the venue.  You could post your cell number on the signage so your participants can call to be let in. {3}

The venue must have a solid Internet connection, preferably with both wired and wireless networking. Where possible create a event specific SSID and Password for the wireless network that is simple to type and write down. A good example would be SSID = hackathon, Password = sponsor2012. {3}

Visit the venue ahead of time and make sure the room and network specifications are up to the challenge. Wireless networks are especially troublesome, so ask to see the access point -- if it looks old/cheap, enquire if you can configure your own more suitable equipment. Ask about outgoing firewalls or network restrictions that could cause problems for developers as they will use ports and network services that may not be used normally. Ports 22, 80 and 443 outbound are especially important to ensure that they are free from blocking/filtering or proxying. {3}

Consider where food will go (best in a separate area), and the location of trash bins, tables, etc. Will everyone in your group be able to sit at a table with their laptop, have access to power, talk in groups, and eat? {3}

The venue should be relatively easy for people from outside of town to locate, with good public transport links. If it’s difficult to reach, try to provide alternative means of transportation, such as coaches to/from local transport hubs throughout the event. Provide a full address, and if necessary, additional instructions to all attendees well in advance of the event. {4}

Include instructions/contacts/getting in arrangements, too (i.e., what do to at reception/security desks). {4}

Print big signs that will guide your attendees to the venue (and in some case inside the venue). {4}

### Sleeping provision
If attendees are staying overnight, then a separate (dark, quiet) area should be available away from the hacking should people decide to sleep. If possible, this should be several areas potentially including dedicated areas, for example male/female/mixed, minors (+chaperones?), snorer/non-snorer, night-owls/early birds.

### Showers Optional
Despite the stereotypes, most geeks like to keep clean. Only a few venues are able to provide showers - but if you can, you should. Make sure you tell attendees well in advance so they can bring towels and toiletries.

### Accessibility
Hack day venues should be accessible to everyone: at a bare minimum, there should be step-free access to all common parts of the building. If an attendee is blind or deaf, they should be able to participate too. Make sure your event signup forms mention accessibility and ask what accommodations might be needed. {4}

### Insurance
Does your venue have the relevant insurance? Are guests’ belongings protected in case of fire or theft? If not, you should make them aware of the risks so they can take extra precautions. Do you, as an organizer have adequate insurance? {4}

### Security
Attendees will often be bringing a lot of expensive kit: laptops, tablets, etc. Make sure they have some security. If the venue does not have some form of lockers, can you run a cloakroom system? {4}

### Secure sites and photo ID
Are the rooms going to be available to non-attendees? Work out whether you are running a secure site and whether people need to bring photo ID; if so, tell them when they sign up and remind them close to the event date. For some people, showing photo ID may be a deal breaker. Not everyone will have ‘government issued ID’, either. Providing proof of address may be hard for some. {4}

## Network

### Your 4MB DSL isn’t enough
Hack days have special requirements: don’t just trust anyone who tells you that “it’ll be fine”. Think about the networking issues, and verify that they work for the kind of capacity you are going to have. People from the venue or their commercial partner will tell you all sorts of things you want to hear but keep in the back of your mind that they may not have any clue what they are talking about. Given the importance of network access, if you are operating a commercial event consider requiring network performance as part of your contract with venues and suppliers. {4}

### Rock solid WiFi
Many commercial WiFi providers plan for much lower use than actually occurs at hack days. The network should be capable of handling at least 4 devices per attendee. {4}

### Minimal firewalling
As a minimum: ports used for SSH (22), DNS (53 — TCP & UDP), VPN (47, 500, 1701, 1723, 5500), HTTP (80), NTP (123 — UDP), HTTPS (443), Submissions (587), IMAPS (993), MSN Messenger (1863), CVS (2401), Subversion (3690), XMPP/Jabber (5222), IRC (6665-9), and Git (9418), must be open and accessible, without the need of proxy servers, and preferably without perimeter-level malware &c checks. {4}

### Subnet / DHCP capacity
Subnet and DHCP server must have capacity for allocating 6 IPv4 (and optionally, IPv6) addresses (preferably a /29) per hacker.  If NAT is not used, attendees should be informed in advance. {4}

### WiFi security
Use WPA2 security over an open WiFi network, to offer some basic protection against the monitoring of other users’ network traffic. {4}

### No device isolation
Attendees should be reminded that when connected to the network, their devices may be accessible to all other devices on the network so they would be wise to secure them. {4}

Organisers should make it clear that they absolve themselves of liability for any intrusion or damage caused over the network. Attendees will want to share resources with other attendees (version control, for example) but while it would be wise for them to do so in a controlled manner it is ultimately up to each individual to be responsible for the security of their own devices, connected or otherwise. {4}

Attendees should be encouraged/advised to run their own firewalls, too, remembering that IPv6 exists. {4}

### IP Whitelisting
For events with 150 attendees or more, you will need to contact organisations such as Twitter, Google, and Freenode in advance to inform them of the increased number of connections from your IP range; they may have an existing process that you should use. {4}

In many cases, rate-limiting is handled by authentication, not IP address (ranges). {4}

For Freenode, email iline@freenode.net with dates, expected number of attendees and IP addresses if possible. {4}

### QoS and Monitoring

Traffic shaping and monitoring should be employed to help prevent a few users abusing the connection to the detriment of all others. {4}

DPI should not be used. {4}

### Ethernet to the Chair Optional
In case of WiFi collapse (or if you can’t provide adequate WiFi at all) you should have ethernet available at the chairs. Have at least fast ethernet feeding into a gigabit backbone arranged in an (extended) star topology. If you go ethernet-only, announce this up-front. Regardless if you provide cables or attendees bring their own, you should have a big pile of spare cables at the venue. {4}

### Single subnet Optional
Both wifi and ethernet should share a single subnet, allowing devices to communicate regardless of how they are connected to the network. {4}

## Power

### Power Sockets
You will need a minimum of 1.5 power sockets available for every seat. That’s a minimum; many attendees will bring two, three, or more devices that require separate power. Have spare cables available. Make sure you have access to the fuses of all used power circuits. {4}

### Portable Appliance Testing
As stated above, your attendees will be bringing two, three, or more devices making full PATs for every device an impossible endeavour. But if you are providing a lot of power strips it can be worth getting them tested. {4}

### Isolated power for hardware hacks *Optional
Isolating the power for those doing hardware hacks is generally a good idea, don’t let one soldering iron knock out the entire venues power. {4}

## Sponsorship

Unless you have a budget for Hackathons, you will want to find a sponsor for your event to cover your costs.  Costs include those for a venue (if you are unable to find a free option), and food.  Your sponsor may be able to provide you with a venue for your event. {3}  

In addition to providing a good working space for your attendees, it’s a good idea to provide plenty of food.  Not only will your attendees appreciate the gesture, but you want them to be able to focus on their projects without the distraction of leaving to get food and drinks.  For a one-day event starting in the morning, be prepared to provide coffee and pastries in the morning, a nutritious lunch with beverages, and snacks, water and cold beverages through the day. {3}

From our experience in various cities in BC, we had 30 attendees on average.  We have had as many as 60 and as few as 12.  Plan on spending $300 to $400 on food and beverages, depending on the number of attendees to your event. {3} 

When you talk to prospective sponsors about your event, they may have never heard of Hackathons.  They will want to know what to expect, so be prepared to explain a bit about Hackathons as well as about your cause.  {3} 

Before you go to talk to your prospective sponsor, think about how they can benefit from your Hackathon so you can explain to them.  Benefits may include: {3}

* positive exposure from the event
* being associated with open data
* being able to meet and talk with the Hackathon attendees
* having attention paid to their particular business area
* exposure for their open data efforts
* having prototype apps created using their data

Be sure to let them know that you’d like to thank them publicly for their support, both on your Hackathon web page and via your social media.  Sometimes event sponsors are happy to help out but are not comfortable with the more public forms of gratitude such as Twitter and Facebook, so be sure you have their permission to mention them in social media.  You want to show thanks in a way that works for them.

The types of organizations that are often happy to help out are: {3} {3}

* Information Technology vendors
* local and provincial governments
* local businesses
* software development firms
* trade associations
* educational institutions

In some cases, you may find an organization that would like to provide the food, but doesn’t have a venue.  In other cases, you may find someone who is willing to provide a venue but not a budget for food.  It works fine for you to have two (or more) sponsoring organizations and and recognize them both. {3}

Part of the benefit of using sponsors is of course covering the costs.  Another benefit is to increase the exposure for your cause, or associate your cause and organization with other organizations.  Remember the reputation of your cause and organization will be affected by the host and sponsor you associate with, and vice versa, so choose organizations that are well respected and easy to work with.  Be respectful, gracious and professional in your interaction with them. {3}

## Speakers

Speakers are in important piece of hackathons.  Often times speakers are representing sponsors, but you should consider workshops and other talks that are more informative and help hackathon participants succeed. {2}

Have a structured approach to structuring your speaker line-up.  Provide a framework for speakers to pariticpate in, providing title and abstracts for their talk within a set format and time line you dictate. {2}

Make sure your speaker line-up is logical and fits well with the theme and schedule of your hackathon.  Also, identify who will be MC'ing the hackathon and coordinating with all scheduled speakers. {2}

### Presentations
Presentations by API and dataset providers should be kept to a minimum, try to make it a quick introduction involving the company name, the type of data / platform they have, and who to speak to for more information. Have technical - not marketing - people give the presentation as they will be asked technical questions, both on stage and during the rest of the event.

### Working APIs
The APIs pitched to attendees should be checked in advance by someone technical to confirm that they are suitable, work, and are of a high enough quality.

### Multiple clients
All APIs should provide client libraries in at least three of the major languages unless there is good reason for them not to (such as the target platform only supporting a single language).

(And if you haven’t got the client libraries written, maybe you need an internal hack day to write them!)

### Clean datasets
Datasets provided for use in the hack day should, where possible, be checked in advance by someone technical to ensure they are well structured and in a sensible format (CSV, XML, JSON, RDF etc., rather than Excel spreadsheets and PDFs).

### Thorough Documentation
All APIs and datasets should have thorough documentation, detailing format, any codes or abbreviations, as well as the underlying assumptions and business logic of what it represents. The documentation should be checked by someone technical before announcing the API.

### Local Downloads
Datasets – especially large datasets – should be available over the network from local servers without the need for registration, and where possible available on USB keys for even faster transfer.

### Make data explorable
Try and ensure that large datasets are accompanied by smaller sample files so attendees can check them for suitability and write parsers using a small number of records before downloading and importing multi-gigabyte files.

### API Keys
If an API requires an key to use it, then make sure that someone is on site and able to authorize the requests quickly, and with as little fuss as possible.

### Licensing
Get clear licensing information from API and dataset providers ahead of time, and communicate those licences clearly to the attendees, remembering that those in the technical community often have strong opinions about open licences for data and code.

### Longevity
Attendees are often averse to building on top of platforms and datasets that could disappear or will incur usage fees after an event, try to avoid companies making resources available only for the duration of the event and communicate clearly the risk of building on top of any alpha or beta APIs.

### Local API testbeds Optional
Where possible test servers for the APIs should be setup on the local network, this allows development to continue in the event of internet failure, and also isolates the live API’s from the increased usage the hack day will cause.

# Preparation

## Website

Hack Weekends guide comes with a ready to go, hackathon website to go with your event.  The website is setup as a separate branch in the Hack Weekends Guide repository.  The Hack Weekends Guide website uses the following technologies: {2}

* [Jekyll] (https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) - Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator 
* [Github Pages] (http://pages.github.com/) - Github Pages provides a simple and free way to public a site on Github

The Hack Weekends Guide Site can be used in conjunction with this guide to deploy a healthy, quick and low-cost web presence for your hackathon. {2}

## Registration

A formal registration process for the hackathon should setup to handle attendees from start to finish.  The most common tool for doing this is Eventbrite, but there are alternatives as well: {2}

* [DoAttend] (http://www.doattend.com)
* [EventBee] (http://www.eventbee.com)
* [EventBrite] (https://www.eventbrite.com)
* [EventHoller] (http://www.eventholler.com)
* [HipCity] (http://www.hipcity.in)
* [SimpleTix] (http://simpletix.com)
* [SocialTables] (https://www.socialtables.com)
* [TicketTailor] (http://www.tickettailor.com)
* [TicketTool] (https://tickettool.net)

A registration process will give you the necessary tools to manage your attendees and understand the scope of your event--as well as give your participants the feeling of organization around the whole process. {2}

Popular event management platforms like EventBrite can also help you market your event and attract developers to the hackathon through a central, established calendar. {2}

When you require your attendees to register, make it clear what information is required for signing up and what the deadline for the registration is. If there’s a maximum number of attendees the venue can handle, communicate how the selection process works and when/how people will be notified if they’ve been granted attendance or not.{4}

If there’s a waiting list for the event, make sure to explain how it works.{4}

Most registration forms lets applicants enter name, contact details and food preferences/allergies (if applicable). Depending on your event and your venue, you might want to ask for additional information - this manifesto lists a few other topics which might make sense to add to the registration form.{4}

There are also a number of things you probably should <u>not</u> ask for, like gender, religious preferences etc.{4}

## Marketing

You will want to promote your event effectively so that you get the mix of attendees you want at your Hackathon. {3}

Your Hackathon attendee list will likely develop organically, which is a good approach.  However, if there are particular groups you would like to have attend (public servants, citizen advocates, developers, students), you will want to think about where best to reach out to them to be sure they know about the event. {3}

There are some tools you could use to promote your event, including:
Twitter - if you are established on Twitter and your Hackathon fits with your normal identity and audience, then use your Twitter account to let the world know.  It may be desirable to create a new account and get help from established and relevant Twitter id’s to help you with promotion.  For example, if you are organizing a community Hackathon to benefit a community cause, connect with the Twitter mavens in your community and ask them to retweet you and otherwise spread the word. {3}

* Facebook - you could create a Facebook page to promote your event.  
* Blogs - if you are a blogger, then write a post about your event.  Brief and succinct are usually good rules of thumb, to be sure the key information is read.  Link to registration or other relevant sites from your post.  You can also ask others who are connected to the cause for your event to blog about it.
* Mailing Lists / Google Groups
* Word of Mouth
* Local Businesses
* Local Government Officials and Representatives

## Social Networking

Have a social networking presence is how you will connect with your attendees, before, during and after an event.  Give your attendees several channels to connect with you, using the social network they prefer: {2}

* Twitter
* Facebook
* Github
* LinkedIn
* Google+

Each of these social networks give you the ability to setup accounts and have a page dedicated to the event. {2}  

If you setup social networking accounts.  Make sure you keep them active and actually engage with your audience. {2}

## Social Bookmarking

Much like social networking, a hackathon audience is using popular social bookmarking tools.  Every aspect of your hackathon marketing should be syndicated to top social bookmarking platforms:

* Hacker News
* Reddit
* StumbleUpon

Make sure your social bookmarking accounts are not just syndicating only your event info.  Employ accounts that are actually syndicating and sharing a wide variety of relevant content for your audience.

## Event Syndication

There are several established and emerging sites for syndicating events to.  Your hackathon should have a standard event profile including:

* Title
* Description
* Tags
* Logo Image
* URL

This information should be used consistently across top event web sites including:

* [DingBee] (http://dingbee.com/)
* [Eventful] (http://eventful.com/)
* [EventSetter] (http://www.eventsetter.com/)
* [Facebook] (http://www.facebook.com/events/)
* [Going] (http://going.com/)
* [Laynyrd] (http://lanyrd.com/)
* [Meetup] (http://www.meetup.com/)
* [Plancast] (http://plancast.com/)
* [UpComing] (http://upcoming.yahoo.com/)
* [ZEvents] (http://www.zvents.com/)

There are many event calendars users will use to discover new events in their local areas.  These represent a few of the top ways to market your event via event calendars.  

Make sure and look for local event sites in your hackathons area.

## Printing

You will have printing needs.

## Merchandise

You will need swag and merchandise.

* T-Shirts
* Stickers

## Food Considerations

### Dietary requirements
Not everyone in the technical community is hypercarnivorous. Be sure to check with your attendees for dietary requirements: food allergies, vegetarians, vegans and people with dietary restrictions. Make provisions to ensure they are provided for equally. If you’re on a budget, prioritise allergies and vegan alternatives; the vegan alternative will satisfy most non-allergy based requirements.

### Breakfast
If your event starts before 11am you should provide breakfast to attendees, either continental or cooked.

### Lunch
You should provide a lunch for each day of the event, this should consist at least of sandwiches (or suitable alternatives for gluten intolerant folk).

### Dinner
If your event runs later than 6pm or overnight you should provide attendees with a proper evening meal, not sandwiches or snacks (and not everybody likes/eats pizza).

### Overnight
If your event runs through the night, you should arrange for food to be available throughout the night, either by periodically refreshing it or supplying something that can still be eaten after it has gone cold.

### Drinks
A selection of coffee, green and black tea (plus milks, sugars), energy drinks, caffeinated and non-caffeinated soft drinks, juices and water should be freely available to attendees throughout the event.

### Snacks
Chocolate, sweets, biscuits, fruit, crisps, etc. should be freely available to attendees throughout the event. Try to ensure there are healthy options too.

### Alcohol
Should be served as if you are the owner of your local bar because, in fact, you are. Check licensing rules with the venue, including where and when alcohol can be served and consumed and what time you need to stop serving. If you have underage attendees, make sure they’re not served alcohol. Penalties for failing to do this could range from a fine to imprisonment for the person providing alcohol and loss of licence for the venue.
