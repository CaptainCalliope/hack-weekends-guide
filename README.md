Hack Weekends Guide
===================

This is an open source template for organizing a hackathon.

This template contains a how-to-guide with accompanying hackathon web site running on Github Pages + Jekyll.

I wanted to provide a single README file for scanning, with as much support material as possible.  So you can easily understand the wonderful world of hackathons and begin planning and executing hackathons in your community.

This open source guide is compiled with material from:

* Research from 2011 / 2012 on Hackathons
* Organizing Hackathons
* Open Data Hackathon How to Guide
* The Hack Day Manifesto
* Numerous tip articles across the blogosphere

I am relicensing this as Creative Commons to keep alignment with contributors and a healthier global hackathon community.

# Overview

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers, interface designers, project managers and computational philologists, collaborate intensively on software projects. Occasionally, there is a hardware component as well. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week in length. Some hackathons are intended simply for educational or social purposes, although in many cases the goal is to create usable software. Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created. Today, this term is not related to "hacking", it is just a programming marathon.{1}

## History

The word "hackathon" is a portmanteau of the words "hack" and "marathon". The term seems to have been created independently by both the developers of OpenBSD and the marketing team of Sun; these usages both first happened in 1999. OpenBSD's apparent first use of the term referred to a cryptographic development event held in Calgary on June 4, 1999, where 10 developers came together to avoid legal problems caused by export regulations of cryptographic software from the United States.{1}

Starting in the mid to late 2000s, hackathons became significantly more widespread, and began to be increasingly viewed by companies and venture capitalists as a way to quickly develop new software technologies, and to locate new areas for innovation and funding.{1}

Hackathon are not intended to perform illegal activities around computer networks. Software developers widely see hacking as a quick and dirty, creative programming solution to a problem.  It is NOT about gaining access to other networks, which is a definition widely publicized by the media and Hollywood.{2}

## Why Hold a Hackathon?
Before you run a Hackathon, it’s useful to think about the purpose behind it.  What are you hoping to accomplish?  Your goal can be as general as “increase awareness around open data” or more specific, such as “fix at least 10 bugs in software application X”.

As well, think about the stakeholders for your event, including attendees, volunteers, sponsors and third parties, and what they might get out the experience or how they might be impacted.  For example, you may want your attendees to be inspired or have them learn new skills.  You might want a third party, for example the homeless, to benefit. 

And finally, it’s useful to think about what you will get out of the event.  Is it an opportunity to build your community?  Perhaps an opportunity to demonstrate leadership or to practice facilitation?

Paying attention to what your various stakeholders might get out of the hackathon and being intentional about people having a positive experience can greatly increase your likelihood of success.  Knowing what you want is a large part of getting it.{3}

# Hackathon Planning

## Assemble a  Team

People like to help out with causes that they believe in.  Involving others in the planning and running of your Hackathon is not only practical, it’s a way to give others an opportunity to contribute.  Here are several practical roles for people that will help your Hackathon run smoothly:

* <strong>Facilitator</strong> - The person who manages the Hackathon process.
* <strong>Ringer</strong> - A participant who understands open data concepts and the technologies involved and who can work on projects and help others to work on their projects.
* <strong>Room Manager</strong> - The room manager is someone that people can go to when they are not sure what to do and would like some direction.  People who attend may have little or no experience with Hackathons.  The room manager is the go-to person for those who do not know what to do or how they can help.  
* <strong>Social Media Manager</strong> - This person will Tweet and update Facebook and Google+ status for your event.  If your organization has its own Twitter or other social media accounts, you may want to consider giving this person temporary access so they can manage the social media tools for the event.{3}

## Title and Description

Give your event a catchy name that represents your goals and will stick in the minds of developers.

Provide a detailed, but concise description of your event.  Generally 250-750 characters is sufficient to explain the theme and goals of the hackathon.

## Format

Hackathons got their beginning in cryptographic software development and was popularized by Silicon Valley startup culture.  However hackathons have moved into a wide variety of niches, not always centered around technology, including:

Art, Civic, Data, Education, Games, Green Energy, Health, Journalism, Language, Mobile, Movies, Music, Photos, Politicis, Robotics, Science, Sports, Water, Women and more.

The boundaries of what format a hackathon can assume is endless.  But there are some great examples being executed globally that might work for your hackathon.

## Size

Hackathons come in all sizes.  They can be as small as 5-10 people or as big as 500.

When it comes to hackathons, bigger isn't always better, but conducting larger events without proper experience and resources can be a major disaster.

Keep size in line with your over goal for throwing a hackathon

## Scheduling

### Choose a Date

Choosing a good date for your Hackathon can have a significant influence on how well it is attended and how much impact it has.  Hackathons take concentrated effort over at least one day, so community Hackathons are typically held on weekends when most people are not working.  Make sure you choose a date far enough in advance to allow yourself time to promote it to attendees.  

In addition, we recommend that if possible, you avoid the following when choosing your date: 
* holiday weekends
*politically significant dates, such as elections, especially if you are organizing a  government open data Hackathon
* religious holidays
* summer months if possible (it can be challenging to gather together attendees, especially in smaller cities.)
* weekends with events already scheduled that will compete with your event for attendees (other Hackathons, ChangeCamps, conferences) {3}

### Choose a Time

It’s important to choose a timeframe that works for your expected audience. If your Hackathon will run from 9am - 5pm and targets working developers, it may be best to host it on a weekend. This will minimize time conflict with your participants’ employment.

Make clear the schedule of your event to participants in advance. If you choose a 9am start time, expect 20% to show up at 10am. Having an itinerary published at event signup will help make sure you can get started earlier. Schedule reception type activities at the beginning of the day to allow for some late arrivals. {3}
